The PRISM stands for Performance RIsk Scoring Module. It comprises a set of 24 pre-defined questions, that can be answered based on the project requirements. The answers to the questions would help to compute a “Performance Risk Score”. The higher the Risk score, the higher is the Performance risk for the application that would warrant a full Performance and Volume (P&V) testing.

The aim of the tool is to help and guide us. As we all know, no tool can replace the  experience of a seasoned Performance Engineer/ Lead/ Manager.
 
The final call on the application performance risk and category will always be decided by the respective Performance Test Manager/Lead of the project.

Hope this utility is helpful to all Performance test engineers.
